With some code chunks, we may not want the output generated by the chunk to be rendered into HTML but would prefer to print the output verbatim. How can we specify this preference for a given code chunk?

Set the option tidy = FALSE

Set the option message = FALSE

Set the option results = "asis"

Set the option highlight = TRUE

When using knitr and R Markdown and producing output in HTML, why should you never edit the resulting HTML file?

The HTML file is not a text file.

Every time you knit() the R Markdown file, the HTML file will be overwritten

Editing the HTML file requires knowledge of a separate markup language.

The Markdown file generated by knitr is the appropriate file to edit.
