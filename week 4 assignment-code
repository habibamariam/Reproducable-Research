## Synopsis:
The basic goal of this assignment is to explore the NOAA Storm Database.

NCDC receives Storm Data from the National Weather Service.

The National Weather service receives their information from a variety of sources, which include but are not limited to: county, state and
federal emergency management officials, local law enforcement officials, skywarn spotters, NWS damage surveys, newspaper clipping services, the insurance industry and the general public.

The data is extracted from the bz2 file and the size of the data is 46.9MB.

the data comprise of 37 different variables and 902297 observations

The purpose of the analysis is to find out answers following issues within United State

1- that all across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health? and also ,
2- Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

Finally i would like to mention that this report is purely an analysis and does not have any recommendation purpose

This document is generated using R markdown file and is in RPuB for your reference.


```{r}
fileURL<-"http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2"
download.file(fileURL,destfile = "./stormData.csv.bz2",method = "libcurl")

NOAA <- read.csv(bzfile("stormData.csv.bz2"), sep=",", header=T)
dim(NOAA)
str(NOAA)
```

## DATA PROCESSING
we try to make the data useable for our analysis, the data has 37 row and we need few of them right now we need the following 3 colums for our anlaysis
```{r}
variables<-c("EVTYPE","FATALITIES","INJURIES","PROPDMG","PROPDMGEXP","CROPDMG","CROPDMGEXP")
NOAA_DATA<-NOAA[variables]
dim(NOAA_DATA)
names(NOAA_DATA)
head(NOAA_DATA)
```
##Part 1
Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?

the analysis include
aggregate the data based on EVTYPE and their sorting ,
we also selected the top 15 rows for the charts

```{r}

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
totfatalities<-aggregate(FATALITIES~EVTYPE,data = NOAA_DATA,sum)
totinjuries<-aggregate(INJURIES~EVTYPE,data = NOAA_DATA,sum)
totfatalities<-totfatalities[order(totfatalities$FATALITIES,decreasing = TRUE),]
fatalities<-totfatalities[1:15,]
head(fatalities,15)
totinjuries<-totinjuries[order(totinjuries$INJURIES,decreasing = TRUE),][1:15,]
head(totinjuries,15)
dim(totinjuries)

```

NOW PLOTTING THE RESULTS  ;
we will be using ggplot and choose different colours for injuries and fatalities graphs
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(fatalities,aes(x=EVTYPE,y=FATALITIES,theme_set(theme_bw())))+geom_bar(stat="identity",fill="blue")+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90,hjust = 1,size = 6))+xlab("Events")+ylab("Total Fatalities")+ggtitle("Top 15 Events That Caused Fatalities ")


ggplot(totinjuries,aes(x=EVTYPE,y=INJURIES,theme_set(theme_bw())))+geom_bar(stat="identity",fill="GREEN")+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90,hjust = 1,size = 6))+xlab("Events")+ylab("Total Injuries")+ggtitle("Top 15 Events That Caused Injuries ")

```

##part 2
2- Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?


We will now convert the PROPDMGEXP & CROPDMGEXP fields to tangible numbers where H (hundreds = 10^2), K (thousands = 10^3), M (millions = 10^6), and B (billions = 10^9)

convert the property damage expenses:

and also the crop damage expenses

finding teh total cost of damage for crops and prooperties
```{r}
library(dplyr)
NOAA_DATA$PROPDMGCOST = 0
NOAA_DATA[NOAA_DATA$PROPDMGEXP=="H",]$PROPDMGCOST= NOAA_DATA[NOAA_DATA$PROPDMGEXP=="H",]$PROPDMG*10^2
NOAA_DATA[NOAA_DATA$PROPDMGEXP=="K",]$PROPDMGCOST= NOAA_DATA[NOAA_DATA$PROPDMGEXP=="K",]$PROPDMG*10^3
NOAA_DATA[NOAA_DATA$PROPDMGEXP=="M",]$PROPDMGCOST= NOAA_DATA[NOAA_DATA$PROPDMGEXP=="M",]$PROPDMG*10^6
NOAA_DATA[NOAA_DATA$PROPDMGEXP=="B",]$PROPDMGCOST= NOAA_DATA[NOAA_DATA$PROPDMGEXP=="B",]$PROPDMG*10^9


NOAA_DATA$CROPDMGCOST = 0
NOAA_DATA[NOAA_DATA$CROPDMGEXP=="H",]$CROPDMGCOST= NOAA_DATA[NOAA_DATA$CROPDMGEXP=="H",]$CROPDMG*10^2
NOAA_DATA[NOAA_DATA$CROPDMGEXP=="K",]$CROPDMGCOST= NOAA_DATA[NOAA_DATA$CROPDMGEXP=="K",]$CROPDMG*10^3
NOAA_DATA[NOAA_DATA$CROPDMGEXP=="M",]$CROPDMGCOST= NOAA_DATA[NOAA_DATA$CROPDMGEXP=="M",]$CROPDMG*10^6
NOAA_DATA[NOAA_DATA$CROPDMGEXP=="B",]$CROPDMGCOST= NOAA_DATA[NOAA_DATA$CROPDMGEXP=="B",]$CROPDMG*10^9


head(NOAA_DATA)
```

now plotting the damage results



```{r}
totaldamage<-aggregate(PROPDMGCOST + CROPDMGCOST ~ EVTYPE ,data = NOAA_DATA,sum)
names(totaldamage)<-c("Event","TotDamageCost")
totaldamage<-totaldamage[order(- totaldamage$TotDamageCost),][1:15,]
totaldamage$Event<-factor(totaldamage$Event,levels = totaldamage$Event)
head(totaldamage)
```

```{r}

ggplot(totaldamage,aes(x=Event,y=TotDamageCost,theme_set(theme_bw())))+geom_bar(stat = "identity",fill="pink")+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90,hjust = 1))+xlab("Events")+ylab("Total Damage Cost in Dollars")+ggtitle("Total Damage cost of Properties and Crops top 15")
```

## RESULTS

Based on our Research - we have analysed and come to following results :

Tornados are the most harmful =weather events to population health within USA as compare to others if we analyse the highest number of fatalities and injuries and also the most expensive severe weather events  that have the greatest economic consequences as per our analsis is Flood.
